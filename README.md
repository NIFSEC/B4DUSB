# B4DUSB
B4DUSB is a tool that allows you to create a USB drive that automatically runs a script when inserted into a computer. This tool is cross-platform and can run on both Windows and Linux systems.

## Features
- Easy setup: simply create a batch or shell script that you want to run, and add it to the USB drive along with the AutoRunPro files.
- Cross-platform: the AutoRunPro script can detect whether it is running on a Windows or Linux system and execute the appropriate script accordingly.
- Customizable: you can choose the name of your script, as well as the icon that appears for the USB drive.

## Usage
1. Download or clone the AutoRunPro repository.
2. Create a batch or shell script that you want to run automatically when the USB drive is inserted.
3. Save your script in the root directory of the AutoRunPro folder, and rename it to `yourscript.bat` for Windows or `yourscript.sh` for Linux.
4. Copy the `autorun.inf`, `AutoRunPro.bat`, and `AutoRunPro.sh` files from the AutoRunPro folder to the root directory of your USB drive.
5. Customize the autorun.inf file to include the name of your script and the icon you want to use for the USB drive.
6. Safely eject the USB drive from your computer.
7. Insert the USB drive into a computer, and the script will automatically run.

Please note that it is important to use caution and ensure that any actions taken by your script are legal and ethical. AutoRunPro is intended for ethical and legitimate purposes only.
